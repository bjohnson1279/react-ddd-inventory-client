## 2024-05-18 - Auth Token Leaked in URL
**Vulnerability:** Sending auth tokens in URL query strings for SSE endpoints
**Learning:** SSE doesn't support custom headers easily, so it's a common anti-pattern to send tokens in URL parameters where they are logged in access logs, proxies, and browser history.
**Prevention:** Use a secure token exchange mechanism, like setting a secure HttpOnly cookie or using short-lived ticket endpoints specifically for SSE.
